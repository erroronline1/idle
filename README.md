these are some of my quite useful scripts (to me) to actually automate recurring tasks.
some of them come from first doodles with the language but evolved to decent tools.

### circular_gallifreyan_unicode
simplified translation from latin characters to unicode representation of circular gallifreyan

gallifreyan is based on television series doctor who by bbc, translation is based on [loren shermans alphabet of circular gallifreyan](http://shermansplanet.com/gallifreyan/guide.pdf)

conversion of phonetic c for english only. platform related unicode inconsistencies though.

### circular_gallifreyan
same as above but with graphical output. favoured grouping of characters still in console.

### imgresize
automated resizing of images within the same directory. useful for preparing blog content. nothing fancy.

### leech
serves to automatically download files according to linked ressources on websites. it is best used from the command line to have access to further options. this is not ai, you'll have to analyze the inhomogeneous sources by yourself beforehand in order to set up. see help for setup syntax.

### rename
rename all files in specified folder. choose if you want to rename all the same (as in file(0).mp3, file(1).mp3, ...), strip parts of filenames (as in file_1_security_copy.mp3, file_2_security_copy.mp3, ...), add something before overwriting while copying into folder (as in file_1_a.mp3, file_2_a.mp3, file_3_a.mp3)

### ruler
creates a background image with scale, spirals and areas according to the devices resolution

### t2aa
text-2-ascii-art can be used from the command line. found it to be useful for structuring and commenting code.
